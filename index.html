                    Location, of course, will also determine the price of delivery, whether it is for a move from one building to another across town, or a piano being delivered from our store to your location.
                    If you are looking for an interstate OR international move/delivery, there will be significant additional charges and we will work with one or various freight companies to deliver your instrument to you. State and customs taxes will apply, and our movers will notify you of this.
